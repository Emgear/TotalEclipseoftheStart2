"Lovely weather lately."
"I saw some strange lights in the sky last night. Wonder what that's about."
"Hello there."
"Hi."
"I'm busy."
"Sorry, but I have a lot to do."
"No time to chat."
"Please go away."
"Hmm?"
"Need something?"
"Yes?"
"You have questions?"
"Tidings."
"Huh?"
"Yeah?"
"Hi there."
"I hope monsters come and eat you."
"Out with it."
"You have something to say?"
"What do you want?"
"Something you need?"
"Make it quick."
"Now why would I want to talk to you?"
"I don't mean you any trouble. Just leave me alone."
"I don't owe you money, do I?"
"What are you starin' at?"
"So nice to have pleasant company for a change."
"Oh, it's you. I was wondering why I was smelling something unpleasant."
"Go away."
"Hmph."
"Aye."
"You're not as dumb as you look."
"Come come. I haven't got all day."
"Well hello."
"What now?"
"Is there... something more I can do for you?"
"Be careful."
